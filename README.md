# umobassignment
The purpose of this repository is have high level understanding on how testing of Umob application can be done, repository includes below points -

A. Test plan- present at tests/Test Documents/Testplan.pdf <br><br>
B. Source code. - present at tests/src/test/java/  <br><br>
C. Instruction to build and run source code - present at tests/Test Documents/Pre-requisites.pdf  <br><br> 
D. Bonus Points - Observation found in application - present at tests/Test Documents/Observations.xlsx <br><br>
E. Things that can be done if have more time. <br><br>
   • Android APK/IPK - If we get access to apk/ipk file of umob application actual automation scripts can be written , for now using dummy apk as umob apk file can't be downloaded.   <br>
   • Automated workflow for User registration and authentication<br>
   • Automated workflow for Booking a ride<br>
   • Automated workflow for Real-time tracking of the vehicle.<br>
   • Automated workflow for Notifications and alerts.<br>
   • Automated workflow for Creating test summary report, bug reports with severity and priority.<br>
   • As this work is done in only 6 hours as per assignment agreement, code refactoring can be done.<br>
   • Conduct load testing using simulated user scenarios.<br>
   • REST API testing can be performed.<br>   

NOTE :- There are some empty folers(src,lib,reports,config) created just to give idea how will be repository structure.<br>
